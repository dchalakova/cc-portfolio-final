<h2>About Me</h2>

<body>
    <div>
        <h3>Education </h3><br>
        I completed my Bachelors in Psychology with a minor in Informatics from the University of Washington in 2023.
        The following year in 2024, I began pursuing <br>
        my MFA in Design and Technology at the Parsons School of Design! I’m motivated to develop my technical and
        visual skills so I can improve people’s lives through design. <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Personal Hobbies</h3> <br>
        My hobbies include rock climbing, going on walks and trying to get into running, playing video games (I love
        Animal Crossing!), and watching movies. <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Career Goals</h3><br>
        At the moment, I'm interested in going into digital design, specifically in the tech sphere through UX design.
        Recently, I've become increasingly interested in also exploring going <br>
        into branding for companies. Although I have no experience in the latter, I'm eager to start learning,
        especially through our program. <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Reflection on my Relationship with Tech</h3><br>
        My relationship with technology and tech is complicated. I grew up thinking I'd go into computer science, so
        I've always enjoyed coding conceptually, <br>
        however, it's never been something that's come easily to me the same way it does to some of my peers. Growing up
        around it, as well as tech as a whole, has made it feel like <br>
        a safe space that I enjoy exploring and dream of making a career in, hence why I'm here at the MFADT program at
        Parsons!
