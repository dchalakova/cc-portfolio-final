<h2>Project 1: Lost and Found</h2>
</p> The description my partner gave me was "The missing item was predominantly green, a bit shiny in some places, and
had a face on it. It was also partly see-through when held against a light source, allowing you to see objects
inside of it. It was very effective and valuable during transactions, and was essential to my security where I was
traveling to."

    Initially, the lack of description of the object details caught me off guard, but once my partner told me what the
    object was, it became much clearer. All throughout the different
    stages of the assignment I struggled with finding a balance between what we perceived to be money if it's in a
    "cartoon" form so to speak and what a real-life dollar bill looks like.
    Before looking up a picture of a dollar bill, I started with making it a very dark green, then tried to make it too
    realistic with the very faded green and gray colors, but neither really worked.
    Did you know that there is more gray on our dollar bills than green? In the end I decided to settle on a combination
    between the two - more faded colors, but
    green in places where we'd expect it to be on cartoon money. Another balance issue I had was questioning for a while
    how much detail to go into. In the end, I decided to ensure that it was obvious it was a dollar bill by adding the
    ones in the right places and putting good ol' George in the middle. The latter took me a while to figure out, as we
    had not learned it in class, but I think especially with using blendMode() to make him the right coloring,
    it made the final result kind of funny and all the more worth it. It ended up being a perfect object for the code we
    were learning, as I got to practice placing and moving around 2D objects on the grid, text placement, rotation, and
    especially with the correct "layering" of the code
    so to speak. The latter was the most difficult for me, but the use of push()/pop() and much practice, I figued it
    out.
