    <p>My Data Portrait was my average heart rate from waking to going to bed from October 9 to October 16. It's not a habit, but something that's important to <br>
        me and I check it pretty often on my Apple Watch. When the user clicks their mouse, it'll change the day of the week, my average heart rate, and the heart will pound at that speed!<br>
        <br>
        The design process consisted of doing maybe too much math, I initially started off with two arrays of minimum and maximum heart rates which I was planning on using respectively, <br>
        but that wasn't computing in my brain for some reason, so I decided to just use the average of them.<br>
        <br>
        I really enjoyed this project, I'm proud of myself for changing the heart beat! To be so honest, I don't know if it accurately beats per minute, but at least it creates an illusion of<br>
        kinds due to the speed changes for the user. I don't think anything was lost by the visualization, if anything it only gains by being able to appeal to visual learners as well while not <br>
        necessarily detracting from those who are not visual learners.  I feel like I definitely need to stop looking at my peers' projects though hahaha they're all soooo so talented, but my little heart does the job! <3</p>
