            Initially, the lack of description of the object details caught me off guard, but once my partner told me
            what the
            object was, it became much clearer. All throughout the different
            stages of the assignment I struggled with finding a balance between what we perceived to be money if it's in
            a
            "cartoon" form so to speak and what a real-life dollar bill looks like.
            Before looking up a picture of a dollar bill, I started with making it a very dark green, then tried to make
            it too
            realistic with the very faded green and gray colors, but neither really worked.
            Did you know that there is more gray on our dollar bills than green? In the end I decided to settle on a
            combination
            between the two - more faded colors, but
            green in places where we'd expect it to be on cartoon money. Another balance issue I had was questioning for
            a while
            how much detail to go into. In the end, I decided to ensure that it was obvious it was a dollar bill by
            adding the
            ones in the right places and putting good ol' George in the middle. The latter took me a while to figure
            out, as we
            had not learned it in class, but I think especially with using blendMode() to make him the right coloring,
            it made the final result kind of funny and all the more worth it. It ended up being a perfect object for the
            code we
            were learning, as I got to practice placing and moving around 2D objects on the grid, text placement,
            rotation, and
            especially with the correct "layering" of the code
            so to speak. The latter was the most difficult for me, but the use of push()/pop() and much practice, I
            figued it
            out.
