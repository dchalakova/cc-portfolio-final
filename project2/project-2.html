    <h3>DESIGN PROCESS:</h3> <br>
    Initially, I wanted to make a ball that would bounce with the movement with the user's mouse, becoming flattened at
    the ground and circular in the air, and changing to a random <br>
    color either at the user's click or when it hits the "ground". However, although I got the ground boundary, I really
    struggled with the sky boundary and keeping the ball from warping when the user's <br>
    mouse went past the boundary. I decided to scrap it and go a different direction by playing around with applying
    random() to multiple things in my design. I wanted the circles to be <br>
    synchronized and dynamic, but also to stand out from the background. I was getting bored of all the background
    colors I chose, so I figured why not make the background ALSO random. Honestly <br>
    that took some time for some reason to figure out how to make the background random, but once I did it was smooth
    sailing for applying that to the rest of my random() code. I decided to not make <br>
    the eyes and mouth warp with the circles so it could always be a sort of cartoony face. I feel like there MUST be a
    function I could make to make the code loop to create them though instead of copy-pasting so much.... <br><br>

    <h3>REFLECTIONS ON FORM:</h3><br>
    I wanted the faces to not be straight-forward, so I made them looking to the side, and since they were circular, I
    thought it would be nice to make their arrangement linear. I feel <br>
    like the form of both these things (the circles as well as their organization) complemented each other nicely. As
    people, we love circular objects - hence why all the villains in the animated <br>
    movies you may have watched growing up (like Disney for example) all have sharp corners. I wanted my faces to feel
    pleasant for the viewer to look at and play around with - some of the random color combinations
    themselves can be unpleasant at times, so I did not want to add any more unpleasantness to our brain's experience of
    the design.</p>
