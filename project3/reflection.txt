My experimental clock is a dandelion growing through time, counting up to 10 seconds and tallying the times that it's counted up to 10. I considered making it more connected to counting minutes as well as the count, but I thought this would make it more novel. I considered making a person growing up for example, but I like the idea that flowers can be used to track time in contrast to their ephemerality more. I had a really hard time figuring out what to do, and because of things happening in my personal life this week, I wasn't able to really get too into the detail of the dandillion - I wish I would have added the puffs on the end to make it more recognizable. 

My overall reflection of this assignment is moreso a personal reflection of the reality check of how much time I need to apply to schoolwork - the first couple weeks were calm, but after not being in school for a bit, this week kind of hit, so ironically I reflected a lot on the concept of time while making a flower grow through time. I really enjoyed some elements of thinking of time outside of the context of clocks though, it's kind of lovely to see how many things are affected by the passing of time.
