PROCESS:
We all respectively drew our different characters, as seen in the assets folder included. I decided to take Ryan's head, Jovana's body, and Shawki's leg to create my character. We didn't really share background stories of our characters, but Ryan mentioned that his character was inspired by his lunch, with the head being a meatball and the little top being a mushroom. 

BACKGROUND STORY:
A background story I've thought of for this character is that he's a mischevious guy who loves to eat mushrooms, only moves on the X-axis, and never shows his hands.

REFLECTION:
I really enjoyed this project! I feel like it was kind of relaxing to draw it out, and the coursor help made it a very smooth process. I liked how all of the parts contrasted with one another to make it seem disjointed and clearly from 3 different characters, it made it seem uniquely cartoon-y. This was also a great project for function practice and comprehension, since if I had written all the individual parts of all characters, instead of commenting out code I donâ€™t want to use but might still be valuable if I want to draw a different permutation of parts, I could just put it in a function and not call that function - giving me a lot of control over my drawing.
